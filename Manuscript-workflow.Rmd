# Creates a PCA based on 5th percentile imputation 
- Data is obtained from the raw data off Spectronaut. It is partitioned into columns that contain the sample information with rows being the proteins.
- Data then undergoes 5th percentile imputation according to the script below. 
- The sample information that defines what each sample represents is provided in a separate csv file called sample_information.
- Data is transposed so the rows and columns are in the right orientation for the PCA to run.

# Volcano plot showing the significantly different proteins between glycerol feeding, glycerol resting, and the subsequent methanol feedings. 

- From the volcano plot, no proteins are significantly different in the data set 

- As we have low sample numbers between the groups - 2 - it becomes difficult for any significant result to occur due to high variability and low degrees of freedom, which can affect the shape of the t-distribution used to calculate the p-values. 

- Empirical Bayes offers an alternative that looks at the entirety of the data set when performing statistics as opposed to the just the proteins of interest within the groups samples. 

- Empirical Bayes methods start with Bayesian principles but uses the data itself to estimate the distributional parameters. 

- Empirical Bayes methods typically involve "shrinking" estimates towards a central value or towards each other, improving the stability and reliability of the estimates. 

- linear models for microarray data- LIMMA - uses Empirical Bayes to estimate the variances and mean differences for each protein. It calculates moderated t-statistics, whic- h are t-statistics that have been adjusted using the EB-estimated variances.

- The moderated t-statistics from this output has ~3.83 degrees of freedom in the context of the moderated t-tests. This is an improvement over the 2 that is provided using just t-test comparisons.

# Hypergeometric test

- Next, the pathways that are identified undergo pathway enrichment.

- Pathways that are statistically over represented among differentially expressed proteins are identified using pathway enrichment analysis. 

- This involves a hypergeometric test, which calculates the probability of observing as many or more differentially expressed proteins in each pathway as occurs in the actual data, under the assumption that proteins are distributed across pathways randomly. Here, 

$$p(k,M,n,N) = \frac{\binom{n}{k} \binom{M-n}{N-k}}{\binom{M}{N}}$$

- k is the number of differentially expressed proteins in a specific pathway, 
- N is the total number of proteins annotated to that pathway in the genome, 
- n is the total number of differentially expressed proteins detected, and 
- M is the total number of proteins annotated to any pathway.


- A Benjamini-Hochberg correction is then applied to adjust p-values for multiple testing.

# Q-Q plot creation 

- This compares the expected and observed p-values between the singificantly different datasets created by comparing glycerol feeding compared to the other 4 sample types. 

- The function first extracts and sorts the non-missing p-values from the results, calculates their -log10 transformation, and computes the expected -log10(p-values) under a uniform distribution based on their rank. Then, it plots these observed versus expected values with ggplot2, adding a red dashed line (slopeâ€¯=â€¯1) to indicate where the points would lie if the observed p-values perfectly matched the uniform expectation.

# Mean-Variance plot

- Allows visual assessment of how residual variability changes with average expression levels between our sample group comparisons.
